# About the Project 

**This is a simple Spring Boot app to send hello world message to a user.**

The reason for this simple project was so that I could pratice and further implement my knowledge in **Docker**. Therfore, I was able to better understand how a **Java Application** is **containerized** using the **SpringBoot** framework, by creating an **Image** defined in **Dockerfile**.

Furthermore, this project also contributed to my development by addresing the good practices of implementing **Unit Tests**, so I understood that the use of **MockMvc** allowos testing the control layer of a **Spring Application** without the need to upload a **real server**, making tests **faster** and more **efficient**.
